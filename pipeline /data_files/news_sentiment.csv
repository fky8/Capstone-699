AMZN,2025-11-13 09:59:38+00:00,"How people are really feeling about the economy, AI, and crypto","From Wall Street to Main Street, 2025 has been a wild ride for markets and the economy. Yahoo Finance hit the streets of New York to learn more about how everyday people are feeling about three of the year's most dominant themes: the economy, artificial intelligence (AI), and cryptocurrency. The economy: While markets have mostly rebounded from their April lows, many Americans say the economic pain hasn't eased. Between tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation to the lingering effects of the government shutdown, the outlook for 2026 remains murky. ""I know a lot of new grads who are having a really hard time getting jobs,"" said Katie, a sales rep at ReportPass. ""I think that's a good sign of the economy ... going down."" AI's rapid rise: AI has officially gone mainstream, and it's not slowing down anytime soon. For example, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a $1 billion partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) to build next-generation data centers, while OpenAI struck a deal with Amazon (AMZN), gaining access to AWS infrastructure and Nvidia's cutting-edge AI technology. As the technology races ahead, New Yorkers are asking: Should we embrace it fully, or start pumping the brakes? Crypto's comeback:Crypto saw major growth in 2025; for example, bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD), and XRP (XRP-USD) hit all-time highs this year before more recently pulling back. However, despite this surge, skepticism remains. Some New Yorkers told Yahoo Finance they still question crypto's staying power and whether it's truly ready for everyday use.

Can Meta still compete in the AI arms race? On this episode of Trader Talk, Kenny Polcari and Tom Hayes dig into Meta's (META) next chapter as the company shifts from social media to AI infrastructure. Hayes explains why Meta’s massive data advantage and ad dominance could make it a dark horse in the AI race, even as investors flock to Nvidia (NVDA) and other chipmakers. They also debate whether Mark Zuckerberg’s pivot to open-source AI is a genius move or a costly distraction in a market obsessed with margins and scale. Watch more episodes of Trader Talk here.

META,2025-11-12 07:37:22+00:00,Big Tech starts complying with Australia's teen social media ban,"STORY: Australian teenagers are set to lose their social media accounts, with a ban on young users set to kick in from December 10. Over the coming days, online platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, Meta and Instagram will notify more than a million teen account holders in the country. Users under the age of 16 must choose an option: Download data, freeze their profiles, or lose everything under the world-first ban on kids using social media.Based on information from insiders, the big platforms plan to deactivate accounts for users under the age of 16.Australia's other 20 million social media users should face no big changes.The move puts the nation out front in shielding young people from online risks.Earlier this year, platforms had warned of total chaos, fearing that they could lose users and face $32 million fines for breaking the rules.They said required age checks would mean constant logins, invade privacy and often be wrong or easy to dodge.But now, firms will use existing software that guesses ages from user habits, instead of asking for birth dates all the time.They will generally only push people to special age-check apps if someone complains about being blocked by mistake.The setup might hit snags at first.Age-check apps which are being deployed at scale for the first time can make mistakes.La Trobe University AI professor Daswin De Silva explains:""One of the challenges with age verification also is this band between 15, 16, 17, how do you distinguish 15 from 16 to 17. So a lot of the technological methods of age verification will fail in that narrow band and there might be false positives where certain individuals who are over 16, slightly over 16 will be banned from these platforms because their content was classified as relevant to under an 16 sort of target demographic.""""It's probably going to be service distortion, service failure for a couple of days or weeks maybe until the platforms figure this out, and we'll see a lot of articles on media and maybe on social media itself of false positives.""Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Google declined to comment.The law states that such platforms must take ""reasonable steps"" to block minors.If the rollout goes smoothly, it could guide the world in cutting kids' exposure to harms like bullying or weight issues from screens.The UK and France added age gates for porn earlier this year. Then in November, Denmark said it would ban under-15s from social media.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=98667538d9f9b16c884472fe71f29b7e04537fa38d3ccbde961be718608a304f,Yahoo,company,0.014580415561795235,0.19629625976085663,0.7891232967376709,-0.7745428811758757
