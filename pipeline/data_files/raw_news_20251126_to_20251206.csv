Very good.”Huang's meeting with Trump comes as the administration considers whether to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China.Those are one generation behind its current flagship semiconductors.Huang also met lawmakers in Washington, where he told them that state-by-state U.S. regulations would slow down AI development.Nvidia also opposed a proposal that would require it to offer its chips to U.S. customers before obtaining licenses to sell them to ""countries of concern.""The company argued the bill would restrict global competition in AI markets.Later in the day, at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Huang downplayed concerns that Nvidia chips are being smuggled in large volumes to countries where they are banned.“A GPU for AI centers, AI data centers. That GPU weighs two tons. It has one and a half million parts. It consumes 200,000 watts. It costs $3 million. Every so often somebody says, you know, 'these GPUs are being smuggled.'
