So we're expecting $2 billion worth of purchases to be made using that type of technology, which shows that consumers are still really excited to make purchases and get value out of the discounts that we're seeing. However, they're looking to figure out ways to make the most of their money and stretch it.”One analyst who tracks consumer pricing tells Reuters that knowing when the best prices will appear is hard to determine because retailers have started promotions so early this year that those deals may not be available for Black Friday or the items could be out of stock.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6322bd3e986dec0f37336300a4f4c07859715e8a8dbc41145dc63963977dbb8d,Yahoo,company
